Learning Management Site for family members

The Family Learning Site is made with .NET MVC, EF and MSSQL. It is published at www.fsdp.hjkangweb.com.
It is designed for parents to share what they hope their children to learn about their family, home caring, life lessons etc.
Parents as an admin role can create courses, lessons with YouTube Video embedded playing and lesson material uploading. 
The admin can read/write all courses, lessons, member information and learning results (full CRUD functionality).
Parents as a supervisor role can read all courses and track learning results and reservations of children and 
get emails when their children finish courses.  
Children can read lessons and see their learning results. 
Children can reserve lessons like driving training lessons. 

The files are parts of the projects.
